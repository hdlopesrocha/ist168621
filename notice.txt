- Why don't we choose XMPP? Multi tabs, reauth on refresh, what strategies?
- Organization and entities
- Own protocol description
- Tests on recording, local download, preload and part switching
- Kurento switch, use the same stream for everything
- Kurento mixing audio, video and screensharing (Chrome VS firefox)
- Kurento record, splits, part switch, audio glitch, no seek
- Kurento without repo, ability to ffmpeg, although is slow, tests with WEBM and MP4
- Kurento repo, scalable but limited due to impossibility to ffmpeg it (no fastforward)
- Kurento limitations on content manipulation, no ffmpeg, no individual soundmeter
- messenger, websockets vs pubsub (extra http connection)
- tags, how they work
- content overlay, how is achieved in the UI? how to synchronize?
- content overlay DB queries, why dont preload in time and preload in N samples (avoid polling)?

- contributions to strophe.js (fixed duplicated user register not giving error)
- contributions to typeahead.js (fixed item access VS text representation access)
