\section{Introduction}
The need to build a global comunication network in an era when almost nobody had access to it, caused that some protocols weren't suitable for a huge increase on the amount of publicly known users. IPv4 limits the number of public addresses in such a way that today are scarse \cite{ipv4}. One way to overcome this problem was the development of a mechanism that groups multiple address into a single one, the machine that is assigned that address is then responsible to redirect messages to members of its group through their private addresses, each element is identified publicly by the same IP address but different ports, this technique is also know as Network Address Translation (NAT).

Initially NAT offered an alternative for address exhaustion and a false sensation of better security, asymetric NAT became a vulgar configuration on the web. As a direct result, problems started to appear, the amount of ports that IP disponibilizes is also small compared to our current needs, worse than that, NAT also difficults end-to-end communication, forcing most of applications that follows this model to be implemented unificiently.

Applications based on multimedia and file sharing were one of the most strained by NAT. Those kind applications requires real time communication in order to achieve the best performance. STUN and TURN \cite{natvoip} servers are a possible solution to overpass NAT, although, none of those an establish direct connections on multiple level NATs.

Most of client-server applications aren't affected by NAT when the servers are public, but they aren't suitable for real time comunication between two private end points. Clearly this type of communication requires a more expensive infrastructure and, at most cases, more network usage, leading to a worse quality of service. The requirements of video comunication makes this kind of model out of question.

On the other hand, TURN uses public servers to redirect traffic between private end points, it may use a P2P network relay to find the best peer, but after that the behaviour is much like client-server. Direct communication is only achieved by STUN when NAT is type \textit{full cone}. {\color{red} [reference to NAT types]}. ICE uses STUN when it's possible and TURN otherwise.

When connection is established, either direct or indirect (via TURN servers), WebRTC cames to simplify how audio and video are transmited.
