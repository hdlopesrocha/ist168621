  Real time collaboration applications have become a huge help on team tasks, providing a great boost on business, research and investigation velocity. Technologies like this are appearing along this days, but they couln't be possible years ago because technology was limited or unavailable. Although todays technology is limited on some aspects, we are doing progress in order to improve the web ecosystem, by creating standards and migrating to newer technologies.

  Our first concern on real time collaboration applications, besides the communication itself, is the data storage and representation. Because most browsers are recommended to limit local storage to at least five megabytes per origin, storing multimedia content is not a viable solution.

  If, for instance, one whants to rewind a real time video, recordings will be needed from who is streaming the video.
